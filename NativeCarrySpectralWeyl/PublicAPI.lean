# Native Carry Spectral Weyl public API

Public import surface for the spectral/Weyl layer.  It exports the exact
periodic profiles and finite-camera coefficient bridge, explicit factors and
their uniform native-line floor, normally convergent bracket characteristics
on `re s > -1`, their initial profile/zeta factorization on `re s > 1`, the
analytically continued cross-factor identity, and the common native-line zero
set of every supported camera.  It also exports the explicit
`O(M⁻³ᐟ²)` cutoff and stable cross-residual estimates, plus every fixed-order
native-line derivative rate `O(M⁻³ᐟ² log(M)^k)`, and equality of analytic zero
multiplicities between all supported cameras on the native line.  The finite
POVM/Cauchy packages and operator-valued Weyl layers remain outside this
surface.
