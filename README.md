# Native Carry Spectral Weyl

Lean 4 formalization of the spectral/Weyl layer associated with the native
carry cameras.

## Current status

The v0.6 analytic-camera milestone contains **156 public kernel-checked Lean
theorems**.  It builds against the exact Green Frame v2.1 commit and the exact
finite native-carry operator commit.  The current public surface proves:

- the bridge from spectral slope/radius counts to the pinned finite-camera
  geometry;
- exact aligned-C2, odd and even periodic coefficient profiles;
- exact periodicity and zero coefficient mean over one camera period;
- the explicit complex factors `A_b(s)` and the native line `s = 1/2 + i t`;
- a simultaneous positive lower bound for every `b >= 2`, hence
  `A_b(1/2 + i t) != 0`;
- a free integer stencil whose scalar coefficients are literal and whose
  evaluation is exactly the pinned `finiteNativeOperator`;
- the complete aligned-C2 formula: finite coefficients equal `c2Profile` on
  `1 <= n <= 4 * cutoff + 1` and vanish outside that window.
- the complete odd natural-camera formula: finite coefficients equal
  `oddProfile` on the full emitted window;
- the complete even natural-camera formula: finite coefficients equal
  `evenProfile` on the strict interior, while the final antipodal coefficient
  is exactly `1 = 2 - 1`, with the correction stated explicitly in Lean.
- absolute summability of every supported periodic-profile Dirichlet series
  on `1 < re s`, and the exact identity
  `profileDirichletSeries b s = factor b s * riemannZeta s` there.
- literal finite and infinite bracket characteristics from the aligned camera
  geometry, with absolute summability for `-1 < re s`;
- normal convergence on compact subsets of `-1 < re s`, locally uniform
  convergence of finite cutoffs, and holomorphy of every limit characteristic;
- exact complex evaluation of the free finite stencil as C2, odd and even
  profile Dirichlet prefixes, including the final even antipodal correction;
- equality of the bracket characteristic with the profile series, hence with
  `factor b s * riemannZeta s`, on the common half-plane `1 < re s`;
- analytic continuation of the cross-factor identity
  `factor 3 s * chi_b(s) = factor b s * chi_3(s)` to `-1 < re s`;
- a holomorphic native scalar `chi_3 / factor 3` on `-1 < re s < 1`, through
  which every supported camera factors, and the common zero set of every
  camera characteristic on `s = 1/2 + i t`.

The common-zero theorem is a theorem about the scalar camera
characteristics.  Equality of local zero multiplicities, quantitative
`O(M^(-3/2))` tails and derivative tails, finite POVM/Cauchy packages and an
operator-valued Weyl family remain separate obligations.  No Parseval or
Poisson statement is used to infer the analytic camera bridge.

Pinned foundations:

- Lean `4.32.0`;
- Mathlib `v4.32.0`, inherited through the pinned dependencies;
- Green Frame commit `cd2d838bee67ad23f869a02f8ed9f0a0feb926fa`
  (`v2.1.0`);
- Finite Native Carry Operator commit
  `00e9d6beb17226545abf5ddf90bbfede6c7146b0` (`v0.1.0`).

## Intended theorem boundary

The formalization will proceed from exact camera arithmetic to finite spectral
objects, then to the countable camera completion, Cauchy transform and an
unbounded Weyl inverse.  Boundary relations and the coupling to the Green
state/port layer come only after their domain and maximality statements are
proved independently.

Three parameters remain permanently distinct:

```text
t       angular parameter of the native orbit
z0      auxiliary non-real defect-probe anchor
lambda  spectral parameter of the Cauchy/Weyl family
```

No equality among them is assumed.  The project does not infer a zeta theorem,
the Riemann hypothesis, a primality criterion, or a zero-selection law from the
existence of a Weyl family.

## Build

```bash
lake update
lake build --wfail NativeCarrySpectralWeyl
```

The theorem registry and claim ledger are active.  A release tag is created
only after the exact candidate SHA passes the remote audit on `main`.
